# TransactMan

### `TransactMan` is a Metamask Snap web3 wallet project that enables developers to call any smart contract functions. It displays the functions to users, allowing them to test and verify them. It also returns the return values of smart contracts and transaction details, as well as any errors that might occur in metamask wallet.

# Problem that we faced

## We need to visit different blockchain explorer to test different smart contracts(DeFi, DAO, DAAP etc.)

## In web2 developers use tools like postman, Thunder Client etc to test the api endpoints. Our implementation helps web3 developers to experience similar functionalities where they can test the smart contracts.


# Solution

### Developers can call any smart contract through metamask snap. If the function is verified, all the functions will be displayed to the users.

### The user can call and test the functions whether it is payable, non payable, write function etc.

### The return value of smart contract function and transaction details will be displayed on metamask wallet.

### The snap will also be able to return errors which are fetched from the smart contract if any, which will be beneficial to the developers.
